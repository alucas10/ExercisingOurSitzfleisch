 Look at my hund, my hund is amazing. 
 My hund is only worthy of gracing the hauptstrausse.
But people love to throw Brot from their Porsches at my Hund while he graces the Haupstrasse.
To combat this, I carry bratwurst in Berlin at all times. 
So, when I walk to the biergarten with my hund along the hauptstrausse in Berlin I have bratwurst to throw back at the Porsches that throw brot at my hund.
Now that I threw all my bratwurst I went to the baeckerei with my hund to buy some gaebeck and brot.
